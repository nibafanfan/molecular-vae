11/23. Kept adjusting NN structure, after we got the encoding part debugged. Learned better ways to look into the layer. x.to(device), also the layer need to be to device.

RuntimeError: CUDA error: device-side assert triggered
CUDA kernel errors might be asynchronously reported at some other API call, so the stacktrace below might be incorrect.
For debugging consider passing CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1.
Compile with `TORCH_USE_CUDA_DSA` to enable device-side assertions.

Tensor.py is running, but the loss is not reducing. 
So I try to troubleshoot, starting from simplying the decoder and see if it learns/
